# Audio Steganography Application

This project develops a GUI Application which can perform audio phase encoding with PKCS1_OAP asymmetric cypher. The creation of asymetric keys allows to grant encoding and decoding privileges to users depending on the specific role. Furthermore, the script "Secret_message_app.py" is used to develop a user friendly GUI to share with friends. Currently, the functions and scripts only support ".wav" files to use as audio input, however a function to download videos as ".wav" files is provided.
